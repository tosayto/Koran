al-Naṣr ( النصر )

3 verses • revealed at Medinan


»The surah that informs the Prophet Muḥammad that The Help of God is imminent in the liberation of Mecca from idolatry, in the throngs whose hearts God will open to Islam, and in the approach of his own passing to the mercy of God. It takes its name from verse 1, in which the phrase “naṣr Allah” (meaning “Allah’s help”) occurs.« 

The surah is also known as: (Divine) Support, The Ultimate Victory.

REVEALED at Mina during the Prophet's Farewell Pilgrimage in the month of Dhu 'l-Hijjah, 10 H. - that is, a little over two months before his death - this is unquestionably the last complete surah conveyed by him to the world. It was preceded one day earlier (on Friday, the 9th of Dhu 'l-Hijjah) by the revelation of the words, "Today have I perfected your religious law for you, and bestowed upon you the full measure of My blessings, and willed that self-surrender unto Me (al-islam) shall be your religion'" (5:3); and since those words were almost immediately followed by the present surah, some of the Prophet's Companions concluded that his mission was fulfilled, and that he was about to die (Bukhari). As a matter of fact, the only revelation which the Prophet received after An-Nasr was verse 281 of Al-Baqarah.

Disc. §. II. p. 55.).

then proclaim the praise of thy Lord, and seek His forgiveness;

for He turns again unto men.


Muhammad Asad


extol thy Sustainer's limitless glory, and praise Him, and seek His forgiveness: for, behold, He is ever an acceptor of repentance.1


1.Implying that even if people should embrace the true religion in great numbers, a believer ought not to grow self-complacent but should, rather, become more humble and more conscious of his own failings. Moreover, the Prophet is reported to have said, "Behold, people have entered God's religion in hosts - and in time they will leave it in hosts" (Ibn Hanbal, on the authority of Jabir ibn Abd Allah; a similar Tradition, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, is found in the Mustadrak).


J. M. Rodwell


Then utter the praise of thy Lord, implore His pardon; for He loveth to turn in mercy. 


E. H. Palmer


Then celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and ask forgiveness of Him, verily, He is relentant! 


George Sale


celebrate the praise of thy Lord, and ask pardon of him1; for he is inclined to forgive.


1.Celebrate the praise of thy Lord, &c.] Most of the commentators agree this chapter to have been revealed before the taking of Mecca, and suppose it gave Mohammed warning of his death: for they say that when he read it al Abbâs wept, and being asked by the prophet, what was the reason of his weeping, answered, Because it biddeth thee to prepare for death; to which Mohammed replied, It is as thou sayest (Al Beidawi.). And hence, adds Jallalo’ddin, after the revelation of this chapter, the prophet was more frequent in praising and asking pardon of God; because he thereby knew that his end approached: for Mecca was taken in the 8th year of the Hejra, and he died in the beginning of the 10th.
