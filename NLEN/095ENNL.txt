The Fig
al-Tīn ( التين )

8 verses • revealed at Meccan


»The surah that opens with the oath of the Divine One swearing by The Fig and the olive, and other signs, representing the Holy Land in which God revealed the Evangel, the Torah, and the Quran, and thereby guided all mankind. It is named after “the fig” (al-tīn) mentioned in verse 1. The surah questions how man can deny the Judgement, and emphasizing the importance of faith and good deeds.« 

The surah is also known as: The Figtree.

By the fig and the olive


Muhammad Asad


REVEALED after surah 85 ("The Great Constellations"), the present surah formulates a fundamental moral verity, stressing the fact that it is common to all true religious teachings. The "title" - or, rather, the key-word by which it is known - is derived from the mention of the fig (i.e., fig tree) in the first verse.

CONSIDER the fig and the olive,


J. M. Rodwell


I SWEAR by the FIG and by the olive,


E. H. Palmer


By the fig! And by the olive!

and this land secure!1


1.The "fig" and the "olive" symbolize, in this context, the lands in which these trees predominate: i.e., the countries bordering on the eastern part of the Mediterranean, especially Palestine and Syria. As it was in these lands that most of the Abrahamic prophets mentioned in the Qur'an lived and preached, these two species of tree may be taken as metonyms for the religious teachings voiced by the long line of those God-inspired men, culminating in the person of the last Judaic prophet, Jesus. "Mount Sinai", on the other hand, stresses specifically the apostleship of Moses, inasmuch as the religious law valid before, and up to, the advent of Muhammad - and in its essentials binding on Jesus as well - was revealed to Moses on a mountain of the Sinai Desert. Finally, "this land secure" signifies undoubtedly (as is evident from 2:126) Mecca, where Muhammad, the Last Prophet, was born and received his divine call. Thus, verses 1-3 draw our attention to the fundamental ethical unity underlying the teachings - the genuine teachings - of all the three historic phases of monotheistic religion, metonymically personified by Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. The specific truth to be considered here is referred to in the next three verses.

We indeed created Man in the fairest stature


Muhammad Asad


Verily, We create man in the best conformation;1


1.I.e., endowed with all the positive qualities, physical as well as mental, corresponding to the functions which this particular creature is meant to perform. The concept of "the best conformation" is related to the Qur'anic statement that everything which God creates, including the human being or self (nafs), is "formed in accordance with what it is meant to be" (see 91:7 and the corresponding note 5, as well as in a more general sense - 87:2 and note 1). This statement does not in any way imply that all human beings have the same "best conformation" in respect of their bodily or mental endowments: it implies simply that irrespective of his natural advantages or disadvantages, each human being is endowed with the ability to make the, for him, best possible use of his inborn qualities and of the environment to which he is exposed. (See in this connection 30:30 and the corresponding notes, especially 27 and 28.)

ثُمَّ رَدَدناهُ أَسفَلَ سافِلينَ

Daarna laten Wij hem weer diep zakken,


Salomon Keyzer


Daarna hebben wij hem tot den laagste der laagsten gemaakt.


Sofjan Siregar


Daarna doen Wij hem terugkeren tot het laagste van het laagste.


Edip Yüksel


Sonra onu aşağıların aşağısı kıldık.


Yasar Nuri Ozturk


Sonra da onu düşüklerin en düşüğüne/aşağıların en aşağısına çevirip attık.

then We restored him the lowest of the low --


Muhammad Asad


and thereafter We reduce him to the lowest of low1


1.This "reduction to the lowest of low" is a consequence of man's betrayal - in another word, corruption - of his original, positive disposition: that is to say, a consequence of man's own doings and omissions. Regarding the attribution, by God, of this "reduction" to His Own doing, see note 7 on 2:7.


J. M. Rodwell


Then brought him down to be the lowest of the low; -


E. H. Palmer


Then we will send him back the lowest of the low;


George Sale


afterwards We rendered him the vilest of the vile:

save those who believe, and do righteous deeds; they shall have a wage unfailing.


Muhammad Asad


excepting only such as attain to faith and do good works: and theirs shall be a reward unending!


J. M. Rodwell


Save who believe and do the things that are right, for theirs shall be a reward that faileth not.


E. H. Palmer


save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged.


George Sale


Except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive an endless reward.

فَما يُكَذِّبُكَ بَعدُ بِالدّينِ



Fred Leemhuis


Wat kan jou over het oordeel nog van leugens betichten?


Salomon Keyzer


Wat zal u dus hierna den dag des oordeels doen loochenen?


Sofjan Siregar


Wat doet jullie dan het oordeel nog loochenen?


Edip Yüksel


Artık neden hala bu dini yalanlıyorsun.


Yasar Nuri Ozturk


Böyle iken dini sana ne yalanlatır?






فَما يُكَذِّبُكَ بَعدُ بِالدّينِ



A. J. Arberry


What then shall cry thee lies as to the Doom?


Muhammad Asad


What, then, [O man,] could henceforth cause thee to give the lie to this moral law?1


1.I.e., to the validity of the moral law - which, to my mind, is the meaning of the term din in this context - outlined in the preceding three verses. (For this specific significance of the concept of din, see note 3 on 109:6.) The above rhetorical question has this implication: Since the moral law referred to here has been stressed in the teachings of all monotheistic religions (cf. verses 1-3 and note 1 above), its truth ought to be self-evident to any unprejudiced person; its negation, moreover, amounts to a negation of all freedom of moral choice on man's part and, hence, of justice on the part of God, who, as the next verse points out, is - by definition - "the most just of judges".


J. M. Rodwell


Then, who after this shall make thee treat the Judgment as a lie?


E. H. Palmer


But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie?


George Sale


What therefore shall cause thee to deny the day of judgment after this?
