Palm Fibre
al-Masad ( المسد )

5 verses • revealed at Meccan


»The surah that mentions the Palm Fibre rope that in Hellfire shall be twisted around the neck of the wife of the Prophet’s uncle, who bitterly opposed Islam; for she took great pride in wearing an ostentatious necklace she became known for and would slip by night to strew thorns and prickly plants in the Prophet’s path to injure his feet. It takes its name from verse 5 in which the phrase “ḥablun min masad” (meaning “a rope of palm fibre”) occurs.« 

The surah is also known as: Abu Lahab, Fibre, Perish, The Flame, The Palm-Fibre Rope.

THIS very early surah - the sixth in the order of revelation - derives its name from its last word. It relates to the bitter hostility always shown to the Prophet's message by his uncle Abu Lahab: a hostility rooted in his inborn arrogance, pride in his great wealth, and a dislike of the idea, propounded by Muhammad, that all human beings are equal before God and will be judged by Him on their merits alone (Ibn Zayd, as quoted by Tabari in his commentary on the first verse of this surah). As reported by several unimpeachable authorities - Bukhari and Muslim among them - the Prophet ascended one day the hillock of As-Safa in Mecca and called together all who could hear him from among his tribe, the Quraysh, When they had assembled, he asked them: "O sons of Abd al-Muttalib! O sons of Fihr! If I were to inform you that enemy warriors are about to fall upon you from behind that hill, would you believe me?" They answered: "Yes, we would." Thereupon he said: "Behold, then, I am here to warn you of the coming of the Last Hour!" At that, Abu Lahab exclaimed: "Was it for this purpose that thou hast summoned us? May thou be doomed!" And shortly afterwards this surah was revealed.

DOOMED are the hands of him of the glowing countennce:1 and doomed is he!


1.The real name of this uncle of the Prophet was Abd al-Uzza. He was popularly nicknamed Abu Lahab (lit., "He of the Flame") on account of his beauty, which was most notably expressed in his glowing countenance (Baghawi, on the authority of Muqatil; Zamakhshari and Razi passsim in their comments on the above verse; Fath al-Bari VIII, 599), Since this nickname, or kunyah appears to have been applied to him even before the advent of Islam, there is no reason to suppose that it had a pejorative significance. - The expression "hands" in the above clause is, in accordance with classical Arabic usage, a metonym for "power", alluding to the great influence which Abu Lahab wielded.

LET the hands of ABU LAHAB perish,and let himself perish!

Abu Lahebs two hands shall perish, and he shall perish!


George Sale


The hands of Abu Laheb shall perish1, and he shall perish2.


1.The hands of Abu Laheb shall perish;] Abu Laheb was the surname of Abd’al Uzza, one of the sons of Abd’almotalleb, and uncle to Mohammed. He was a most bitter enemy to his nephew, and opposed the establishment of his new religion to the utmost of his power. When that prophet, in obedience to the command he had recieved to admonish his near relations (See the Prelim. Disc. §. II. p. 43.), had called them all together, and told them that he was a warner sent unto them before a grievous chaslifement, Abu Laheb cried out, Mayst thou perish! hast thou called us togehter for this? and took up a stone to cast at him. Whereupon this passage was revealed (Al Beidawi, Jallal. &c.). 
By the hands of Abu Laheb some commentators, by a synecdoche, understand his person; others, by a metonymy, his affairs in general, they being tranfacted with those members; or his hopes in this world, and the next.
2.And he shall perish;] He died of grief and vexation at the defeat his friends had received at Bedr, surviving that misfortune but 7 days (Abulf. vit. Mob. p. 57). They add, that his corpse was left aboveground three days, till it stank, and then some negro’s were hired to bury him (Al Beidawi).

1.His riches shall not profit him, &c.] And accordingly his great poffessions, and the rank and esteem in which he lived at Mecca, were of no service to him, nor could protect him against the vengeance of God. Al Beidawi mentions also the lost of his son Otba, who was torn to pieces by a lion, in the way to Syria, though surrounded by the whole caravan.

and his wife, the carrier of the firewood,


Muhammad Asad


together with his wife, that carrier of evil tales,1


1.Lit., "carrier of firewood", a well-known idiomatic expression denoting one who surreptitiously carries evil tales and slander from one person to another "so as to kindle the flames of hatred between them" (Zamakhshari; see also Ikrimah, Mujahid and Qatadah, as quoted by Tabari). The woman's name was Arwa umm Jamil bint Harb ibn Umayyah; she was a sister of Abu Sufyan and, hence, a paternal aunt of Muawiyah, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. Her hatred of Muhammad and his followers was so intense that she would often, under the cover of darkness, scatter thorns before the Prophet's house with a view to causing him hurt; and she employed her great eloquence in persistently slandering him and his message,


J. M. Rodwell


And his wife laden with fire wood, -


E. H. Palmer


and his wife carrying faggots!-


George Sale


and his wife also1, bearing wood2,


1.His wife;] Her name was Omm Jemîl: she was the daughter of Harb, and sister of Abu Sofiân.
2.Bearing wood;] For fewel in hell; bacause she somented the hatred which her husband bore to Mohammed; or, bearing a bundle of thorns and brambles, because she carried such, and strewed them by night in the prophet’s way (Idem, Jallal).

upon her neck a rope of palm-fibre.


Muhammad Asad


[who bears] around her neck a rope of twisted strands!1


1.The term masad signifies anything that consists of twisted strands, irrespective of the material (Qamus, Mughni, Lisan al-Arab). In the abstract sense in which it is evidently used here, the above phrase seems to have a double connotation: it alludes to the woman's twisted, warped nature, as well as to the spiritual truth that "every human being's destiny is tied to his neck" (see 17:13 and, in particular, the corresponding note 17) - which, together with verse 2, reveals the general, timeless purport of this surah.
