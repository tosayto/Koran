Abundance
al-Kawthar ( الكوثر )

3 verses • revealed at Meccan


»The surah that informs the Prophet Muḥammad that God has gifted him with Abundance goodness in this life and far greater resplendence in the Hereafter—for which he is instructed to ever show gratitude and charitable generosity. It takes its name from “the abundance” (al-kawthar) mentioned in verse 1. The surah comes to reassure the Prophet Muḥammad and as a retort to his enemy.« 

The surah is also known as: Abundant Goodness, Plenty, Pre-eminence, The Great Abundance.

WHEREAS most of the authorities assign this surah to the early part of the Mecca period, Ibn Kathir considers it most probable that it was revealed at Medina. The reason for this assumption (shared by many other scholars) is to be found in an authentic hadith on the authority of Anas ibn Malik, who narrates - with a good deal of circumstantial detail - how the surah was revealed "while the Apostle of God was among us in the mosque" (Muslim, Ibn Hanbal, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i). The "mosque" referred to by Anas can only have been the mosque of Medina: for, on the one hand, Anas - a native of that town - had never met the Prophet before the latter's exodus to Medina (at which time Anas was barely ten years old); and, on the other hand, there had been no mosque - i.e., a public place of congregational worship - available to the Muslims at Mecca before their conquest of that city in 8 H. The three verses of the surah are addressed, in the first instance, to the Prophet and, through him, to every believing man and woman.

BEHOLD, We have bestowed upon thee good in abundance:1


1.The term kawthar is an intensive form of the noun kathrah (Zamakhshari), which, in its turn, denotes "copiousness", "multitude" or "abundance"; it also occurs as an adjective with the same connotation (Qamus, Lisan al-Arab, etc.). In the above context, which is the sole instance of its use in the Qur'an, al-kawthar obviously relates to the abundant bestowal on the Prophet of all that is good in an abstract, spiritual sense, like revelation, knowledge, wisdom, the doing of good works, and dignity in this world and in the hereafter (Razi); with reference to the believers in general, it evidently signifies the ability to acquire knowledge, to do good works, to be kind towards all living beings, and thus to attain to inner peace and dignity.

TRULY we have given thee an ABUNDANCE;


E. H. Palmer


Verily, we have given thee El Kauthar;


George Sale


Revealed at Mecca. There are some, however, who think it to have been revealed at Medina.

Verily we have given thee al Cawthar1.


1.Al Cawthar.] This word signifies abundance, especially of good, and thence the gift of wisdom and prophecy, the Korân, the office of intercessor, &c. Or it may imply abundance of children, followers, and the like. It is generally, however, expounded of a river in paradise of that name, whence the water is derived into Mohammed’s pond, of which the blessed are to drink before their admission into that place (See the Prelim. Disc. §. IV. p. 95.). According to a tradition of the prophet’s, this river, wherein his Lord promised him abundant good, is sweeter than honey, whiter than mlik, cooler than snow, and smoother than cream; its banks are of chrysolites, and the vessels sels to drink thereout, of silver; and those who drink of it shall never thirst (Al Beidawi, Jallal. &c.). 
Eutbymius Zigabenus (In Panoplia dogmat. inter Sylburgii Saracenic. p. 29.), instead of Cauthar, reading Cantbar, supposes the word to have the same signification in Arabic as in Greek, and translates the two first verses of the chapter thus; [Greek translation] i.e. We have given thee the beetle; wherefore pray unto thy Lord, and slay it: and then he cries out, O wonderful and magnificent sacrifice, worthy of the legislator !

So pray to thy Lord and slaughter (victims).


George Sale


Wherefore pray unto thy Lord, and slay the victims1.


1.Pray unto thy Lord, and slay the victims;] Which are to be sacrificed, at the pilgrimage, in the valley of Mina Al Beidawi explains the words thus: Pray with servency and intense devotion, not out of hypocrisy; and slay the fatted camels and oxen, and distribute the flesh among the poor: for he says this chapter is the counterpart of the preceding, exhorting to those vertues which are opposite to the vices there condemned.
