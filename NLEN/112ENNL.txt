Monotheism
al-Ikhlāṣ ( الإخلاص )

4 verses • revealed at Meccan


»The surah whose six elements of belief constitute pure sincerity of faith or Monotheism, wherein a believer affirms God’s divinity, Oneness, and eternality, and negates in relation to Him any offspring, ancestry, or likeness. It negates any kind of anthropomorphism that may compromise pure monotheism. It is unusual in having as its title a term not mentioned in the body of the surah. The word “Ikhlas” conveys the meaning of sincerity in one’s religion and total dedication to the One true God.« 

The surah is also known as: Divine Unity, Oneness, Pure Faith, Pure Sincerity, Pure Truth, Purity (of Faith), Sincere Religion, Sincerity, The Purity of Faith, Unity.

AS REPORTED in a great number of authentic Traditions, the Prophet was wont to describe this surah as "equivalent to one-third of the whole Qur'an" (Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Hanbal, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah). It seems to have been revealed in the early part of the Mecca period.

This chapter is held in particular veneration by the Mohammedans, and declared, by a tradition of their prophet, to be equal in value to a third part of the whole Korân. It us said to have been revealed in answer to the Koreish, who asked Mohammed concerning the distinguishing attributes of the God he invited them to worship (Iidem.)

Say, God is one God;

1.This rendering gives no more than an approximate meaning of the term as-samad, which occurs in the Qur'an only once, and is applied to God alone. It comprises the concepts of Primary Cause and eternal, independent Being, combined with the idea that everything existing or conceivable goes back to Him as its source and is therefore, dependent on Him for its beginning as well as for its continued existence.

"and there is nothing that could be compared with Him.1


1.Cf. note 2 on 89:3, as well as surah 19, note 77. The fact that God is one and unique in every respect, without beginning and without end, has its logical correlate in the statement that "there is nothing that could be compared with Him" - thus precluding any possibility of describing or defining Him (see note 88 on the last sentence of 6:100). Consequently, the quality of His Being is beyond the range of human comprehension or imagination: which also explains why any attempt at "depicting" God by means of figurative representations or even abstract symbols must be qualified as a blasphemous denial of the truth.
